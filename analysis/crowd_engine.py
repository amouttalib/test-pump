===============
Crowd Positioning Engine for pump.fun — adapted from the OMEGA perps design
to the signals that actually exist on Solana memecoins.

THE THESIS (unchanged from the OMEGA design):
> We don't trade the price. We trade the positioning of the crowd: detect when
> it's overcrowded at an extreme, and take the trade that hurts the most people
> (the reverse cascade).

On Binance perps the crowd signals are funding rate + L/S ratio + sentiment.
On pump.fun there are no perpetuals, so "crowd positioning" is measured from:

  1. ORDER FLOW pressure  — buy/sell ratio on the bonding curve. An extreme
     buy/sell ratio (>4:1) means the crowd is all-in long on a token that
     has nowhere to go but down (everyone who will buy has bought).
  2. HOLDER VELOCITY     — how fast new wallets are piling in. A vertical
     spike in unique holders signals FOMO overcrowding (late money, weak
     hands, cascade-prone).
  3. SENTIMENT HYPE       — Twitter/Telegram mention velocity. Parabolic
     hype = retail FOMO peak = the crowd is at its most overcrowded.
  4. BONDING CURVE %      — near-completion (>90%) means the token is about
     to migrate; the crowd expects a pump but migration often disappoints
     (sell the news).

Each signal produces a score in [-1, +1]:
  +1 = crowd is maximally overcrowded LONG (FOMO, euphoria) → we FADE (sell/avoid)
  -1 = crowd is maximally overcrowded SHORT (capitulation, fear) → we FADE (buy)
   0 = neutral / no edge

The engine fuses them into a single CrowdPositioningEvent with a conviction
that is REDUCED when signals disagree (divergent crowd = weak setup).
